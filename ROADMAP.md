Move interfaces:

```ts
function createProject(G: G, ctx: ctx, projectCardIndex: number, jobCardIndex: number): void

function recruit(G: G, ctx: ctx, jobCardIndex: number, activeProjectIndex: number): void

function contributeOwnedProjects(G: G, ctx: ctx, contributions: { activeProjectIndex: number; jobName: JobName; value: number }[]): void

function contributeOtherProjects(G: G, ctx: ctx, contributions: { activeProjectIndex: number; jobName: JobName; value: number }[]): void

function refillJobremoveAndRefillJobs(G: G, ctx: ctx, jobCardIndices: number[]): void

function mirror(G: G, ctx: ctx, actionName: string, ...params: any[]): void
```

#### Settle Stage

> TODO: migrate into action stage. Projects closed immediately when fulfilled the requirements

* [x] Close projects

#### Discard Stage

* [ ] Discard project cards

```ts
function discardProjectCards(G: G, ctx: ctx, projectIndices: number[]): void
```

#### Refill Stage

* [x] Refill and End
  * [x] Refill project cards
  * [x] Refill action points

Move interface:

```ts
// inner function
function refillProject(): void {}

// exposed function
function refillAndEnd(G: G, ctx: ctx): void
```

#### Unit tests

* [ ] Find a proper game-flows and integration tests btw different game states *[T]*
  * [ ] Survey boardgame.io unit tests use cases
  * [ ] Find solution and proposal

#### User Interface / User Experience

* [x] Design UI flow scratch
  * references as follows
  * [stone age](https://boardgamearena.com/gamepanel?game=stoneage)
  * [pandemic](https://boardgamearena.com/gamepanel?game=pandemic)
  * [agricola](https://boardgamearena.com/gamepanel?game=agricola)
* [x] Decide Styling tools

  Note: Principle component guildline is fully decouple the styling component with layout components.
  eg. ProjectCard (layout logic) depends on Card (Component with styles)

  * Tailwind: We would love to try new things (Fancier :rocket:)
  * Styled component: We would love to try new things (Classic :tada:)
  * SASS: Old school
  * ~~Material UI~~
  * ~~Boostrap~~

  Highly customised is our two project directions so Material UI and Bootstrap are not fit in our roadmap
* [x] Design client folder structure
  1. feature + style
  * src/
    * features/
      * ResourceCard/
        * ?styled.jsx
      * ProjectCard
      * EventCard
    * styled/
      * CardVertical
      * CardHorizontal
      * ?ResourceCard.styled.jsx

  2. feature
  * src/
    * features/
      * ResourceCard/
        * ResourceCard.jsx
        * ResourceCard.styled.jsx
      * ProjectCard/
        * ProjectCard.jsx
        * ProjectCard.styled.jsx
      * EventCard/

  Folders should be structured by features (scenario 2) but it is viable to have common styled components such as Button, Tab, or Input collected in the common folder (styled foder in scenario 1).
* [x] Header
* [x] Table
  * [x] Table Layout
  * [x] Projct Card (read)
* [ ] Play Project cards *[T]*
* [ ] Play Job cards
* [ ] Contribute the projects

### Apply New Rules

* [x] Decouple Job and Force cards in Player Hand
* [x] Split Job and Force cards deck

```ts
// inner function
function refillProject(): void {}
function refillJob(): void {}
function refillForce(): void {}
```

* [x] Refactor project cards
* [x] Add victory points
* [x] Refactor worker token on project card
* [x] Remove goal cards
* [x] Remove force cards from main game

#### Discard Stage

* [ ] Discard force cards
