          work with collaborators to solve these societal issues and promote

    title: Project Card | Never-ending Cases
    columns:
      - text: A total of 39 project cards are available throughout the game, including
          open government, data, and source code projects. Players can choose
          projects based on their interests and abilities and then complete them
          through strategic resource allocation. From daily personal life
          challenges to significant environmental policy formulation, solutions
          lie within the collective and collaborative spirit. Through the design
          of open-source Project Cards, you can experience the diversity of tech
          tools used in these real-world projects and how solutions were
          achieved collaboratively. Each Project Card has different levels of
          difficulty depending on the project scope, which will earn you varying
          victory points once completed.

          Just like any tech tools, software, or websites, they weren't made
          based on only codes. Open StarTer features 7 different talent cards,
          each contributing their unique expertise, perfectly addressing the
          diverse requirements of developing tech tools! Skills like content
          creation, graphic design, legal analysis, and programming are
          recruited based on player project needs! Recruit and gather your
          forces, all for the common good.

    columns:
      - text: A project isn't complete without a splash of frustration and some
          challenges. Draw an Event Card each round to add spice to your project
          progression, whether it's a shark biting through an undersea cable
          causing an internet blackout, a mysterious flu outbreak turning people
          into Otakus, or even a sudden show of support from officials for tech
          openness. Various obstacles and resources directly impact your
          planning and strategy. With 15 simulated event cards, players can
          expect different surprises (and disasters) on their path to project
          execution.
