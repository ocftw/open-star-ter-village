        text: >-
          You're not the only one bothered by numerous public concerns. These
          issues can range from small everyday inconveniences to critical work
          needs or even larger societal problems. Think about frequently missing
          buses, the slow disappearance of native languages, or the confusing
          candidate information during elections and so on. These are the things
          everyone wants to change, but often we're unsure where to start. \

          There's a way to put you on the shoulders of giants — Open Source.\

          Through open resources and technology, apply the achievements of predecessors, cooperate with partners, and make practical scientific and technological tools or services to fundamentally improve problems.\

          Unfortunately, when you hear "technology tools", everyone always has the impression that "you can write programs to participate

          **As real as your life!**\

          Whether it is a shark biting off a submarine cable and directly disconnecting the network, the inexplicable spread of pneumonia makes people change their homes; Or the newly appointed officials support the opening of science and technology, and the real world will encounter large and small events that affect the development of technology and the popularization of open concepts.

        subtitle: 解決問題，不只嚷嚷而已！
        text: >-
          **Solving problems is not just shouting!**\

          From daily personal life to environmental conservation policy formulation, in the face of small challenges and problems, one person can not think of a solution, a group of people can always solve it! Through the open source project card design, from the real open source projects and the results of cooperation with everyone, we can see the diversity of scientific and technological tools!

        subtitle: 理念一致卻各有所長！
        text: >-
          **The same philosophy, but each has its own strengths!**\

          If you want to do a good job, you must first find the right person! Opening any technological tool, software, or web page, it's not just about having code, right? When facing a problem, if there is something you don't understand, seek help from someone. The copy that engineers can't write, the bill that they don't understand, the pronunciation that they can't pronounce, the topic they don't understand, the art that they can't draw—all these issues can be solved through collaboration. Character cards with seven different skills, each playing to their strengths, perfectly meet the diverse needs of developing technology tools!

        text: "**Project Card - Mask Map** is one of the projects of the gov-zero (G0V)
          of Taiwan's open source community, in response to the Wuhan pneumonia
          epidemic in 2020, the Taiwan government adopted mask real-name system
          measures. In just a few days, community participants connected with
          real-time inventory data of pharmacies opened by various governments,
          mask distribution information and locations of medical institutions
          and supermarkets, etc., to create an application to view the stock of
          masks in various places in real time."

          discussion of the issue"
        text: '**Project card - Scan and Buy** is an application derived from the
          "Transparent Footprint" project, which promotes environmental data
          disclosure, tracks real-time monitoring data of pollution indicators
          such as corporate waste gas and wastewater, and records of illegal
          penalties. It is hoped that black-hearted enterprises will be
          identified, the government will be promoted to improve the legal
          system of environmental protection and the enterprise control system,
          and at the same time strengthen citizen participation and supervision,
          and check the consumption choice every time!'

        text: "**Project Card - Citizen Judges** can not only open up to Congress and
          the executive branch, but also the courts can become government
          departments that allow citizens to participate! The Legislative Yuan
          passed the National Judges Law in 2020 and is expected to be
          officially launched in 2023. The collegial panel of the Act will be
          composed of six national judges and three professional judges, and
          eligible and randomly selected citizens may participate in the court
          discussion and judgment process. It is hoped that judicial justice
          will be implemented together in combination with the social
          expectations of the people and the professionalism of judges."
