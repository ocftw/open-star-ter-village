          From missing buses and declining heritage languages to confusing
          pre-election candidate information, we live in a society with many
          issues that impact our daily lives. These concerns aren't just yours;
          they belong to us all. We all yearn for change and transparency, yet
          often feel powerless. 


          Open-source is the idea that solutions can be built on the shoulders of giants. Through collective efforts, we, as members of society, can contribute to finding solutions. 


          Open Source, through accessible resources and technological prowess, allows collaboration with partners, leveraging the achievements of predecessors to create practical tech tools and services, fundamentally improving problems. 


          "Tech tools" aren't exclusive to "coders." Through openness and cooperation, we aim to explore how individuals with diverse skills and a passion for solving societal issues can collaboratively create "tech tools"!

    title: " Open Culture Foundation (OCF) x Promoting Open Source"
    columns:
      - text: >-
          [Open Culture Foundation](https://ocf.tw/en/) is dedicated to
          promoting the ideas of open source and open resources, shattering the
          misconception that "changing the world requires coding skills." We aim
          to foster a dialogue between technology and society, promote diversity
          in the open-source community, and address a broader range of issues.
          Working with passionate volunteers and [FNF Global Innovation
          Hub](https://www.freiheit.org/taiwan), the development of the tabletop
          game, "Open StarTer Village," is a result of our efforts in promoting
          open-source through different platforms. 


          One of the main concepts in the game is to experience project management: by utilizing real-world open-source projects, players experience project management from drafting a project, and recruiting talents, to seeing the fruition.  While we are in a world where technology drives changes, it is not a coder-exclusive club. To push for changes, diverse talents such as content creators, marketing specialists, copyeditors and law are equally indispensable in the world of open-source. 


          This game is an adventure of change and a fusion of diverse expertise. We hope that through it, you'll grasp the essence of open-source projects and realize that all skill sets hold crucial value in the journey of reshaping the world.
