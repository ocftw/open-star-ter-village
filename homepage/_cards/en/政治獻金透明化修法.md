In 2014, with a crowdsourcing model, Ronny Wang, a participant in the g0v community, collaborated with other civil society groups on the "Open Political Donation" project, which hoped to make political donation more transparent through legal amendments. After several attempts, the effort went silent for a while. In 2017, Mirror Media produced a report on open data, which received a lot of attention and enabled this issue to be visable again. Finally, in 2018, the Political Donations Act was ammended and since then, it requires every candidate to publish the full text of their financial reports online.
