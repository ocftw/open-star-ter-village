In order to enable citizens to monitor the government and apply open data, Taiwan’s Executive Yuan began promoting open data in 2012. People can use most of open data for free except for some special cases. A platform compiling civic, economic and other types of open government data was thus created, and the data were released in a variety of formats, making them easier for citizens to use.
