In order to enable citizens to monitor the government and apply open data, Taiwanâ€™s Executive Yuan began promoting open data in 2012. People can use most of open data for free except for some special cases. A platform compiling civic, economic and other types of open government data was thus created, and the data were released in a variety of formats, making them easier for citizens to use.
