In 2015, Taiwan’s National Development Council launched Join.gov.tw: a digiital public policy participatory platform. Through the platform, citizens are able to submit proposals regarding the policies or issues they care about. If their proposals receive 5000 supporters’ “yeses” in 60 days, authorities in charge are required to reply within 2 months. This platform thus has become a two-way communication channel between citizens and the government.
