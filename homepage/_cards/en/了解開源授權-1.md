Licensing is an indispensable element for achieving open source. "Open License" allows copyright owners to retain only part of their rights, allowing their works to be used, modified and distributed freely and for unlimited purposes. The additional terms added on the license of an open license software must not violate the authorization terms of these basic principles of Open License. Common license terms for software code include MIT, GPL, etc., and since the content of each license is different, the scale of freedom of reuse is also different.
