This is some basic, sample markdown.

## Second Heading

* Unordered lists, and:

1. One
2. Two
3. Three

* More

> Blockquote

And **bold**, *italics*, and even *italics and later **bold***. Even ~~strikethrough~~. [A link](https://markdowntohtml.com) to somewhere.

And code highlighting:

```js

```

Or inline code like `var foo = 'bar';`.

Or an image of bears

The end ...
